# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for comprehensive real integration tests for the PlacementConnect system. The tests will validate end-to-end functionality by testing actual API endpoints, database operations, and component interactions without mocking. The testing framework will use Vitest with a real PostgreSQL test database to ensure authentic system behavior validation.

The integration tests will cover all major functional requirements including user registration/authentication, job posting lifecycle, application workflows, administrative operations, and cross-component data consistency. Each test suite will simulate real user interactions and validate system responses across the entire technology stack.

### Test Database Strategy

- **Dedicated Test Database**: Use a separate PostgreSQL database for testing to avoid conflicts with development data
- **Database Seeding**: Create consistent test data before each test suite
- **Transaction Rollback**: Use database transactions that can be rolled back after each test
- **Schema Validation**: Ensure test database schema matches production schema

## Components and Interfaces

### Test Database Manager

**Purpose**: Manages test database lifecycle, seeding, and cleanup operations.

**Key Methods**:
- `setupTestDatabase()`: Initialize test database with schema
- `seedTestData()`: Create consistent test data for each test suite
- `cleanupDatabase()`: Remove test data after tests complete
- `createTransaction()`: Start database transaction for test isolation
- `rollbackTransaction()`: Rollback changes after test completion

**Database Seeding Strategy**:
- Create test users for each role (Student, Recruiter, TPO)
- Generate sample job postings in various approval states
- Create sample applications with different statuses
- Ensure referential integrity across all test data

### API Test Client

**Purpose**: Provides a consistent interface for making HTTP requests to API endpoints with authentication handling.

**Key Methods**:
- `authenticateUser(credentials)`: Login and store session cookies
- `makeRequest(method, endpoint, data)`: Make authenticated API requests
- `registerUser(userData)`: Register new users with role-specific data
- `createJobPosting(jobData)`: Create job postings as recruiter
- `submitApplication(applicationData)`: Submit job applications as student

**Authentication Handling**:
- Store session cookies from login responses
- Include cookies in subsequent requests
- Handle session expiration and re-authentication
- Support role switching for multi-user scenarios

### Test Data Factory

**Purpose**: Creates consistent, realistic test data for various scenarios.

**Key Methods**:
- `createStudentData()`: Generate student registration data with academic records
- `createRecruiterData()`: Generate recruiter data with company information
- `createJobPostingData()`: Generate job posting data with eligibility criteria
- `createApplicationData()`: Generate application data linking students and jobs

**Data Consistency**:
- Ensure email uniqueness across all user types
- Generate realistic academic records for students
- Create valid company profiles for recruiters
- Maintain referential integrity in relational data

### Workflow Test Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Coordinates complex multi-step workflows involving multiple user roles.

**Key Methods**:
- `executeRegistrationWorkflow()`: Complete user registration and approval process
- `executeJobPostingWorkflow()`: Create, approve, and publish job postings
- `executeApplicationWorkflow()`: Submit and track job applications
- `executePlacementWorkflow()`: Complete end-to-end placement process

**Workflow Coordination**:
- Manage state transitions across multiple API calls
- Validate intermediate states during workflow execution
- Handle error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Ensure proper cleanup after workflow completion

## Data Models

### Test User Profiles

```javascript
// Student Test Profile
const testStudent = {
  name: "Test Student",
  email: "student.test@example.com",
  password: "TestPassword123!",
  role: "STUDENT",
  enrollmentNo: "TEST001",
  facultyNo: "FAC001",
  academicRecords: {
    classXPercentage: 85.5,
    classXIIPercentage: 88.2,
    courseEnrolled: "Computer Science",
    college: "Test College",
    currentCGPA: 8.5,
    currentYearSemester: "Final Year",
    resumeLink: "https://example.com/resume.pdf"
  }
};

// Recruiter Test Profile
const testRecruiter = {
  name: "Test Recruiter",
  email: "recruiter.test@example.com",
  password: "TestPassword123!",
  role: "RECRUITER",
  companyName: "Test Company Inc.",
  companyProfile: "Leading technology company specializing in software development"
};

// TPO Admin Test Profile
const testTPO = {
  name: "Test TPO Admin",
  email: "tpo.test@example.com",
  password: "TestPassword123!",
  role: "TPO"
};
```

### Test Job Posting Data

```javascript
const testJobPosting = {
  jobDescription: "Software Developer position for fresh graduates with strong programming skills in JavaScript and React",
  eligibilityCriteria: "Minimum 70% in Class X and XII, CGPA above 7.0, Computer Science background preferred",
  applicationDeadline: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 30 days from now
};
```

### Test Application Data

```javascript
const testApplication = {
  jobId: "job_id_from_test_job",
  studentId: "student_id_from_test_student",
  applicationStatus: "APPLIED"
};
```

## Error Handling

### Test Failure Scenarios

**Database Connection Failures**:
- Implement retry mechanisms for database connections
- Provide clear error messages when database is unavailable
- Skip tests gracefully when database setup fails

**API Endpoint Failures**:
- Validate API responses for expected status codes
- Handle network timeouts and connection errors
- Provide detailed error context for debugging

**Data Consistency Issues**:
- Implement data validation checks before and after operations
- Detect and report data corruption scenarios
- Provide rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### Test Environment Validation

**Pre-Test Validation**:
- Verify database connectivity and schema
- Validate environment variables and configuration
- Check API endpoint availability

**Post-Test Cleanup**:
- Ensure complete data cleanup after test completion
- Validate database state after cleanup operations
- Report any cleanup failures for investigation

## Testing Strategy

### Test Isolation Strategy

**Database Transactions**:
- Wrap each test in a database transaction
- Rollback transaction after test completion
- Ensure no test data persists between tests

**Session Management**:
- Clear all session cookies between tests
- Reset authentication state for each test
- Prevent session leakage between test scenarios

### Test Data Management

**Seeding Strategy**:
- Create fresh test data for each test suite
- Use deterministic data generation for reproducible tests
- Maintain referential integrity across all test data

**Cleanup Strategy**:
- Remove all test data after test completion
- Validate complete cleanup before next test execution
- Handle cleanup failures gracefully

### Performance Considerations

**Test Execution Speed**:
- Use database transactions for fast rollback
- Minimize API calls through efficient test design
- Parallel test execution where possible

**Resource Management**:
- Limit concurrent database connections
- Implement connection pooling for test database
- Monitor memory usage during test execution

### Continuous Integration Integration

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:
- Provide test database setup scripts for CI environments
- Generate test reports in standard formats
- Integrate with existing CI/CD workflows

**Test Result Reporting**:
- Generate detailed test reports with coverage metrics
- Provide failure analysis and debugging information
- Track test performance and reliability metrics
