# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive real integration tests for the PlacementConnect system. These tests will validate the major functional requirements by testing actual component interactions, real API calls, and end-to-end workflows without mocking. The tests will ensure that all critical user journeys work correctly across the entire system stack including database operations, authentication, and multi-component interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration and Authentication Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive integration tests for user registration and authentication flows, so that I can ensure all user types can successfully register, login, and access their appropriate dashboards with proper role-based access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new student registers with valid academic details THEN the system SHALL create a student account with PENDING_STUDENT status AND store academic records in the database
2. WHEN a new company recruiter registers with valid company information THEN the system SHALL create a recruiter account with PENDING_RECRUITER status AND store company profile data
3. WHEN a TPO administrator approves a pending student account THEN the system SHALL update the account status AND grant access to student dashboard
4. WHEN a TPO administrator approves a pending recruiter account THEN the system SHALL update the account status AND grant access to recruiter dashboard
5. WHEN a user attempts to login with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user AND redirect to the appropriate role-based dashboard
6. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected route without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
7. WHEN a user attempts to access a route not authorized for their role THEN the system SHALL deny access AND show appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Job Posting Lifecycle Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration tests that validate the complete job posting lifecycle from creation to student applications, so that I can ensure the job management workflow functions correctly across all user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an approved recruiter creates a new job posting THEN the system SHALL store the job with PENDING approval status AND notify TPO administrators
2. WHEN a TPO administrator approves a job posting THEN the system SHALL update the approval status to APPROVED AND make the job visible to students
3. WHEN a TPO administrator rejects a job posting THEN the system SHALL update the approval status to REJECTED AND notify the recruiter
4. WHEN an approved recruiter edits an existing job posting THEN the system SHALL update the job details AND reset approval status to PENDING if significant changes are made
5. WHEN an approved recruiter deletes a job posting THEN the system SHALL remove the job AND handle any existing applications appropriately
6. WHEN students search for jobs THEN the system SHALL return only APPROVED job postings that match the search criteria
7. WHEN students filter jobs by eligibility criteria THEN the system SHALL return jobs that match their academic profile

### Requirement 3: Job Application and Tracking Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration tests that verify the complete job application process and status tracking, so that I can ensure students can successfully apply for jobs and track their application progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an approved student applies for an approved job posting THEN the system SHALL create an application record with PENDING status AND link it to both student and job
2. WHEN a student attempts to apply for the same job twice THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate applications AND show appropriate error message
3. WHEN a student applies for a job past the deadline THEN the system SHALL reject the application AND show deadline exceeded message
4. WHEN a recruiter updates an application status to SHORTLISTED THEN the system SHALL update the application record AND notify the student
5. WHEN a recruiter updates an application status to INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED THEN the system SHALL update the status AND provide interview details to the student
6. WHEN a recruiter updates an application status to HIRED THEN the system SHALL update the status AND trigger placement confirmation workflow
7. WHEN a student views their application dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all applications with current status and relevant details

### Requirement 4: Administrative Dashboard and Reporting Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration tests that validate the TPO administrative dashboard functionality and reporting capabilities, so that I can ensure administrators can effectively manage the system and generate accurate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TPO administrator accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current statistics including pending approvals, active jobs, and recent applications
2. WHEN a TPO administrator views the user management section THEN the system SHALL display all pending user registrations with approval/rejection options
3. WHEN a TPO administrator views the job management section THEN the system SHALL display all job postings with their approval status and management options
4. WHEN a TPO administrator generates a placement report THEN the system SHALL compile accurate data from applications, jobs, and student records
5. WHEN a TPO administrator exports placement data THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable reports in appropriate formats (PDF, Excel)
6. WHEN a TPO administrator searches for specific students or recruiters THEN the system SHALL return accurate results with relevant details
7. WHEN a TPO administrator performs bulk operations THEN the system SHALL process all selected items AND provide feedback on success/failure status

### Requirement 5: Cross-Component Data Consistency Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration tests that verify data consistency across all system components, so that I can ensure data integrity is maintained throughout all user interactions and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is updated in one component THEN all related components SHALL reflect the updated information consistently
2. WHEN a user account is deleted THEN all related data (applications, job postings) SHALL be handled according to data retention policies
3. WHEN concurrent users perform operations on the same data THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency AND prevent race conditions
4. WHEN database transactions fail THEN the system SHALL rollback changes AND maintain data integrity
5. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained across all operations
6. WHEN reports are generated THEN the data SHALL be accurate AND consistent with the current database state
7. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL maintain complete logs of all critical operations

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Workflow Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration tests that validate complete end-to-end workflows spanning multiple user roles, so that I can ensure the entire placement process works seamlessly from job posting to final placement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing the complete placement workflow THEN the system SHALL support the full journey from recruiter registration to student placement
2. WHEN multiple users interact with the same job posting simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations correctly
3. WHEN the placement process involves multiple approval steps THEN each step SHALL be validated AND proper notifications sent
4. WHEN errors occur during multi-step workflows THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages AND allow recovery
5. WHEN workflows span multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain state consistency across user sessions
6. WHEN notifications are triggered during workflows THEN all relevant parties SHALL receive appropriate notifications
7. WHEN workflow completion requires data aggregation THEN the system SHALL compile accurate summary information
