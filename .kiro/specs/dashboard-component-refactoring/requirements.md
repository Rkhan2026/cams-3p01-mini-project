# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing long dashboard pages in the placement management system by extracting reusable components and splitting complex pages into smaller, more maintainable pieces. The goal is to improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract reusable UI components from dashboard pages, so that I can maintain consistent design patterns and reduce code duplication across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining dashboard pages THEN the system SHALL identify common UI patterns like buttons, cards, headers, and icons
2. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL create reusable components in the components directory
3. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent prop interfaces and styling
4. WHEN components are extracted THEN the system SHALL ensure they can be used across multiple dashboard pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to split long dashboard pages into smaller components, so that the codebase is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dashboard page exceeds 300 lines THEN the system SHALL split it into logical component sections
2. WHEN splitting pages THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality and behavior
3. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN refactoring pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user interface and user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize components in a logical directory structure, so that components are easy to find and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new components THEN the system SHALL organize them in appropriate subdirectories within components/
2. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL group related components together (e.g., dashboard/, ui/, shared/)
3. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names that indicate their purpose
4. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between feature-specific and reusable components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all refactored components maintain accessibility and responsive design, so that the application remains usable across different devices and for users with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring components THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing ARIA attributes and accessibility features
2. WHEN creating new components THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design patterns
3. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper keyboard navigation support
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent focus management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain consistent styling and theming across extracted components, so that the visual design remains cohesive throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL use consistent Tailwind CSS class patterns
2. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL support theme variations through props
3. WHEN refactoring styling THEN the system SHALL maintain existing color schemes and spacing
4. WHEN components are extracted THEN the system SHALL ensure hover states and transitions are preserved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all refactored components are properly typed and documented, so that they are easy to use and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL include proper JSDoc comments for component purpose and props
2. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent prop naming conventions
3. WHEN refactoring components THEN the system SHALL ensure all props have appropriate default values where needed
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include usage examples in comments where helpful
