# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the remaining long dashboard pages in the placement management system by extracting reusable components and splitting complex pages into smaller, more maintainable pieces. Based on analysis, several pages have already been well-refactored (student/applications, recruiter dashboard, TPO dashboard, student dashboard), but several critical pages still need significant component extraction work. The goal is to improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Current Analysis

**Pages Already Well-Refactored:**
- Student Applications Page (~150 lines) - Good component extraction
- Recruiter Dashboard (~150 lines) - Well-organized with extracted components  
- TPO Dashboard (~180 lines) - Good component structure
- Student Dashboard (~150 lines) - Proper component extraction
- Student Profile Page (~120 lines) - Simple server component, well-structured

**Pages Requiring Immediate Refactoring:**
- **Student Jobs Page** (~280 lines) - Multiple inline components, complex logic
- **Student Job Details Page** (~300+ lines) - Many inline components, mixed concerns
- **Recruiter Applications Page** (~400+ lines) - Very long with multiple inline components
- **Recruiter New Job Page** (~300+ lines) - Large form with inline components
- **TPO Jobs Management Page** (~350+ lines) - Complex approval logic with inline components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract reusable UI components from the remaining long dashboard pages, so that I can maintain consistent design patterns and reduce code duplication across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the Student Jobs Page THEN the system SHALL extract reusable JobCard, SearchBar, and EmptyState components
2. WHEN examining the Student Job Details Page THEN the system SHALL extract reusable PageHeader, InfoBlock, and ApplicationStatus components  
3. WHEN examining the Recruiter Applications Page THEN the system SHALL extract reusable ApplicationCard, StatPill, and ActionButtons components
4. WHEN examining the Recruiter New Job Page THEN the system SHALL extract reusable FormField and form validation components
5. WHEN examining the TPO Jobs Management Page THEN the system SHALL extract reusable JobApprovalCard and FilterTabs components
6. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL create reusable components in the appropriate components directory structure
7. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent prop interfaces and styling
8. WHEN components are extracted THEN the system SHALL ensure they can be used across multiple dashboard pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to split the remaining long dashboard pages into smaller components, so that the codebase is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dashboard page exceeds 300 lines THEN the system SHALL split it into logical component sections
2. WHEN splitting the Student Jobs Page THEN the system SHALL extract JobCard, JobCardSkeleton, SearchBar, and EmptyState components
3. WHEN splitting the Student Job Details Page THEN the system SHALL extract PageHeader, InfoBlock, ApplicationStatus, and JobDetailsSkeleton components
4. WHEN splitting the Recruiter Applications Page THEN the system SHALL extract ApplicationCard, StatPill, ApplicationStatsHeader, and ActionButtons components
5. WHEN splitting the Recruiter New Job Page THEN the system SHALL extract FormField, TpoApprovalNote, and form validation components
6. WHEN splitting the TPO Jobs Management Page THEN the system SHALL extract JobApprovalCard, FilterTabs, and approval action components
7. WHEN splitting pages THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality and behavior
8. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
9. WHEN refactoring pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user interface and user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize the newly extracted components in a logical directory structure, so that components are easy to find and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Student Jobs components THEN the system SHALL organize them in components/dashboard/student/ directory
2. WHEN creating Recruiter components THEN the system SHALL organize them in components/dashboard/recruiter/ directory  
3. WHEN creating TPO components THEN the system SHALL organize them in components/dashboard/tpo/ directory
4. WHEN creating shared UI components THEN the system SHALL organize them in components/ui/ directory
5. WHEN creating shared dashboard components THEN the system SHALL organize them in components/dashboard/shared/ directory
6. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names that indicate their purpose (e.g., JobCard.jsx, ApplicationStatus.jsx)
7. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between feature-specific and reusable components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all refactored components maintain accessibility and responsive design, so that the application remains usable across different devices and for users with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring components THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing ARIA attributes and accessibility features
2. WHEN creating new components THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design patterns
3. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper keyboard navigation support
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent focus management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain consistent styling and theming across extracted components, so that the visual design remains cohesive throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL use consistent Tailwind CSS class patterns
2. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL support theme variations through props
3. WHEN refactoring styling THEN the system SHALL maintain existing color schemes and spacing
4. WHEN components are extracted THEN the system SHALL ensure hover states and transitions are preserved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all refactored components are properly typed and documented, so that they are easy to use and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL include proper JSDoc comments for component purpose and props
2. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent prop naming conventions
3. WHEN refactoring components THEN the system SHALL ensure all props have appropriate default values where needed
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include usage examples in comments where helpful
