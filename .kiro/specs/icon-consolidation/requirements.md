# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves consolidating all icons used in dashboard pages into a centralized `components/ui/icons.js` file and updating all dashboard pages to import icons from this single location. Currently, icons are scattered across multiple files with some defined inline within pages, making maintenance difficult and creating inconsistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dashboard icons consolidated in a single location, so that I can easily maintain and update icons across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all dashboard pages are analyzed THEN all icon usage SHALL be identified and catalogued
2. WHEN icons are consolidated THEN a single `components/ui/icons.js` file SHALL contain all dashboard icons
3. WHEN the consolidation is complete THEN no inline icon definitions SHALL exist in dashboard pages
4. WHEN icons are moved THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent icon imports across dashboard pages, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows a standard pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard pages import icons THEN they SHALL import from `components/ui/icons.js`
2. WHEN icon imports are updated THEN all dashboard pages SHALL use the same import pattern
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN no dashboard page SHALL import icons from multiple locations
4. WHEN icons are imported THEN the import statements SHALL be clean and organized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing icons to be properly defined, so that the application has a complete icon library for dashboard functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN missing icons are identified THEN they SHALL be added to the consolidated icon file
2. WHEN new icons are added THEN they SHALL follow the same component pattern as existing icons
3. WHEN icons are defined THEN they SHALL accept className and other props for customization
4. WHEN the consolidation is complete THEN all dashboard functionality SHALL work without errors
