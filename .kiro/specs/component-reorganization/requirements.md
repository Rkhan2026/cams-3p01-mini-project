# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on reorganizing the core components that are still actively used in the placement management system. The goal is to move these components from the root components directory into appropriate subdirectories based on their functionality and usage patterns, while updating all import paths throughout the application to maintain functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize core components into logical subdirectories, so that the component structure is more maintainable and follows clear organizational patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move BackButton.jsx to components/ui/ directory as it's a reusable UI component
2. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move Header.jsx to components/layout/ directory as it's a layout component
3. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move Logo.jsx to components/shared/ directory as it's used across multiple contexts
4. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move RoleCard.jsx to components/ui/ directory as it's a reusable card component
5. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move Toast.jsx to components/ui/ directory as it's a reusable notification component
6. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move PlacementReportEnhanced.jsx to components/reports/ directory as it's report-specific
7. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL move PlacementReportGenerator.jsx to components/reports/ directory as it's report-specific

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import paths to be updated automatically when components are moved, so that the application continues to function without any broken imports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving BackButton.jsx THEN the system SHALL update the import in app/(dashboards)/student/profile/page.js
2. WHEN moving Header.jsx THEN the system SHALL update the import in app/layout.js
3. WHEN moving Logo.jsx THEN the system SHALL update imports in app/page.js, app/auth/register/page.js, all dashboard layouts (student/layout.js, recruiter/layout.js, tpo/layout.js), and components/Header.jsx
4. WHEN moving RoleCard.jsx THEN the system SHALL update the import in app/page.js
5. WHEN moving Toast.jsx THEN the system SHALL update the import in app/layout.js
6. WHEN moving PlacementReportEnhanced.jsx THEN the system SHALL update the import in app/(dashboards)/tpo/reports/page.js
7. WHEN moving PlacementReportGenerator.jsx THEN the system SHALL update any existing imports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all moved components maintain their exact functionality and styling, so that the user experience remains unchanged after the reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are moved THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing component code without modifications
2. WHEN components are moved THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing prop interfaces and component behavior
3. WHEN components are moved THEN the system SHALL preserve all styling and CSS classes
4. WHEN components are moved THEN the system SHALL ensure all component exports remain the same

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create the necessary directory structure for the reorganized components, so that the new organization is properly established.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL create components/ui/ directory if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL create components/layout/ directory if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL create components/shared/ directory if it doesn't exist
4. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL create components/reports/ directory if it doesn't exist
5. WHEN creating directories THEN the system SHALL ensure proper folder structure is maintained

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all applications and pages continue to work correctly after the component reorganization, so that no functionality is broken during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the homepage (app/page.js) loads correctly with Logo and RoleCard components
2. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the main layout (app/layout.js) works correctly with Header and Toast components
3. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all dashboard layouts load correctly with Logo component
4. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the student profile page works correctly with BackButton component
5. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the TPO reports page works correctly with PlacementReportEnhanced component
6. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the registration page works correctly with Logo component
