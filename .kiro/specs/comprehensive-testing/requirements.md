# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive testing strategy for the PlacementConnect placement management system. The testing framework will ensure code quality, functionality, performance, and security across all components including authentication, job management, application processing, and user interfaces for students, recruiters, and TPO administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all components, so that I can ensure individual functions work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any React component is modified THEN the system SHALL have corresponding unit tests that verify component rendering and behavior
2. WHEN any utility function is created or modified THEN the system SHALL have unit tests that cover all code paths and edge cases
3. WHEN any API route handler is implemented THEN the system SHALL have unit tests that verify request/response handling and error scenarios
4. WHEN any database model or Prisma operation is used THEN the system SHALL have unit tests that verify data operations and constraints
5. IF a component has props or state THEN the system SHALL test all prop combinations and state transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for API endpoints, so that I can ensure different system components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL have integration tests that verify login, registration, and session management
2. WHEN any job posting endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL have integration tests that verify CRUD operations and authorization
3. WHEN any application management endpoint is used THEN the system SHALL have integration tests that verify student-job interactions
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL have integration tests that verify data persistence and relationships
5. IF an API endpoint requires authentication THEN the system SHALL test both authorized and unauthorized access scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end tests for critical user workflows, so that I can ensure the complete user experience functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student registers and applies for jobs THEN the system SHALL have E2E tests that verify the complete workflow
2. WHEN a recruiter posts jobs and reviews applications THEN the system SHALL have E2E tests that verify the complete workflow
3. WHEN a TPO admin manages approvals and system oversight THEN the system SHALL have E2E tests that verify administrative functions
4. WHEN users navigate between different pages THEN the system SHALL have E2E tests that verify routing and navigation
5. IF any critical business process exists THEN the system SHALL have E2E tests covering the complete user journey

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests for the application, so that I can ensure the system performs well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application handles multiple concurrent users THEN the system SHALL have performance tests that verify response times remain acceptable
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify query performance and optimization
3. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify memory usage and processing efficiency
4. WHEN API endpoints are called repeatedly THEN the system SHALL have load tests that verify system stability
5. IF any operation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL have performance benchmarks to identify bottlenecks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security tests for authentication and authorization, so that I can ensure user data and system access are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt to access protected resources THEN the system SHALL have security tests that verify proper authorization
2. WHEN authentication credentials are processed THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify password hashing and session security
3. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify input validation and sanitization
4. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify data protection and privacy measures
5. IF any security vulnerability is possible THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify protection against common attacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accessibility tests for UI components, so that I can ensure the application is usable by all users including those with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UI component is rendered THEN the system SHALL have accessibility tests that verify ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
2. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
3. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify proper labeling and error messaging
4. WHEN color or visual elements convey information THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify alternative text and contrast ratios
5. IF any accessibility standard applies THEN the system SHALL have tests that verify WCAG compliance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution and reporting, so that I can continuously monitor code quality and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically execute all relevant tests and report results
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and failure context
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive coverage reports
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and execution time analysis
5. IF any test category fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify developers of issues
